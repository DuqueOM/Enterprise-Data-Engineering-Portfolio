This file lists concrete steps to achieve the requested goals for P1.

Scope: P1 serves DataOps/validation components used by P4 but remains independent.

1) README root TL;DR
- P1 already has README. Consider adding a 1-page TL;DR with quick commands:
  * Create venv, install requirements
  * Run validate_data, normalize_data, generate_quality_report

2) Publish dataset v0.1 to HF
- Typically handled in P2. For P1, ensure processed outputs have schema + LICENSE + source.

3) LoRA smoke + push model
- Not in P1 scope. Handled by P3 (training/inference) or a separate repo.

4) Eval script (F1/EM + latency)
- Optional in P1. Recommend keeping eval in P3 or P4.

5) Video demo (script + recording)
- Non-code. Draft script in the root video_demo_script.md.

6) LEGAL.md (licenses, PII policy)
- Non-code. Recommend central LEGAL.md at repo root; P1 references it.

7) CI smoke .github/workflows/ci_smoke.yml
- P1 already has workflows. Concurrency guard added in workflows/smoke.yml [P4].

8) DVC pipeline dvc.yaml
- Lives in P4; P1 can export expectations/schemas if needed.

9) Stress tests (k6) + canary
- Not applicable in P1 (no service). Use P3/P4.

10) Cost analysis
- Non-code. Add docs/costs.md at repo root; P1 references it.

11) PII sanitizer
- Implemented in P4; P1 can re-use.

12) Colab notebook
- Optional. Keep in P4 or a separate demos folder.
